# Project Gallery

## Overview

Create a gallery showcasing at least three of your projects from this semester, selected from the following options:

- FAQ
- Music Player
- Profile Creator
- Product Catalog

This gallery will function like a single-page application (SPA) using the [htmx](https://htmx.org) library to request and display individual project files without reloading the browser.

Continue reading for more specific design requirements.

## Prep

1. Design a custom nav bar with links to a Home page and three different Project pages.
2. Design the content for your Home page.
3. Collect images and other media files from your selected projects and place them in the appropriate locations in the Project Gallery folder.
4. Transfer the content from each project's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to the designated locations in the provided files in the Project Gallery folder (see comments within files for clarification).

## Content and Design Requirements

### Nav Bar

The persistent nav bar should be styled and updated with the chosen project names (do not modify the `id` of the buttons). _This is changed in the main index.html and style.css files._

### Home

The home page should serve as an introduction to you and your work. This is the first thing that visitors will see. There are no specific requirements on the content or styling of this page. _This is changed in the index.html and style.css files within the home folder._

### Projects

You may optionally modify the styling of your original projects (e.g. colors and fonts) to create a more cohesive gallery appearance.

## Interaction and Behavior Requirements

The project template has been configured to manage page navigation and transitions. If you want to customize the transitions:

- Modify the style properties and/or duration of the `.htmx-swapping` class to adjust how old content is removed.
- Modify the style properties and/or duration of the `.htmx-settling` class to adjust how new content is added.
- Ensure that the `swap` and `settle` durations in the `body` tag of the main `index.html` file match the durations in the `.htmx-swapping` and `.htmx-settling` classes, respectively.

## Technical Requirements

This projectâ€™s main challenge will be managing file organization as you consolidate multiple projects into one directory.

The Project Gallery folder is structured as follows:

- The main `index.html` and `style.css` files determine the appearance and behavior of the nav bar.
- The main `script.js` file handles loading and unloading of project pages. DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE.
- The `index.html` and `style.css` files within the `home` folder determine the appearance of the Home page.
- The `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files within the individual project folders determine the appearance and behavior of the each project.

Within each Home and Project `style.css` and `script.js` files, be sure to read the comments and follow instructions for nesting style selectors and inserting code within the provided functions. _This is important for scoping styles and initializing JavaScript for each project when they load._

Everyone's code is different, so _expect that there will be some growing pains._ Modifications to your original code may be required to work within this new gallery framework. Work slowly, test one thing at a time, and be patient with yourself!

## Submission

_It is recommended that you Stage and Commit after each major change (steps 1-3) and Sync often (step 4), even before you are finished._

1. Open the **Source Control** panel in VS Code.
2. Stage all changes by clicking the **+** next to **Changes**.
3. Enter a commit message and click the **Commit** button (use "finished" for your final commit).
4. The **Commit** button should change to a **Sync Changes** button. Click this to finish syncing the latest changes to your online GitHub repository.
5. Find your repository on GitHub.
6. _There is no draft stage for this project. You do not need to create a draft branch._
7. Go to the **Settings** tab within the repository and navigate to the **Pages** section.
8. Under **Branch**, select the appropriate branch to publish (main) and click **Save**.
9. After a few moments, if you refresh the page, there should now be a URL near the top next to a **Visit Site** button. If you click this button, you should see your site open in a new window.
10. Copy the URL generated by GitHub Pages, paste it in the Website URL field of the corresponding Canvas assignment, and click **Submit Assignment**.

## Grading

**36 points total**

Your grade for the Project Gallery will focus primarily on the design and functionality of your nav bar, Home page, and the successful transfer of project files. Previous project grades will not be revisited or affect this assessment - any points lost on earlier projects will not be deducted again in the Project Gallery evaluation.

Refer to the rubric on Canvas for detailed grading criteria.
